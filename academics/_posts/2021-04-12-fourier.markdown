This was an assignment where we had to detail an application of complex numbers. I spent around three days trying to find a great application and landed on the fourier transform from signal analysis videos! The report also includes a wonderful, real world analysis example where a time series is broken into individual sine waves. 

All images that are unreferenced (all but one), including the graphs and spiral images, were all created using functions in R. These were quite finnicky, to be honest. 

ggplot2 was used to plot the cartesian planes. 

The report was created using RSweave/LaTeX. 

It should be noted the formatting is sometimes... off. Looking back on this I probably would have wanted
