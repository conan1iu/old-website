This was an assignment where we had to design a textbook chapter on an application of matrices. I chose neural networks! 

We also had to design some problems with worked solutions at the end of the chapter. 

The textbook was designed in Adobe Illustrator. All diagrams are handmade, also in Illustrator. I used Helvetica Neue for the font in the neural network diagrams, but looking back on this in retrospect, I think another, slightly bolder typeface would have helped the readability (especially with those super/subscript numbers!).
