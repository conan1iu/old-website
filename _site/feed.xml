A creative piece I wrote on the destructive nature of expectations; inspired by Hedda Gabler (Ibsen).

The Doctor shall truly marvel at this discovery ... my discovery. The hanging gardens ...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In two words, utterly and incomprehensibly beautiful – but the humidity is rather suffocating. However, we’ve worked so hard to get here ... I will admit, I encountered a few difficulties, but that’s over ... we were even dwindling on meat, but no more! And what a contrast this place provides ... the gardens are literally covered ... brimming ... crawling with life, and there are spontaneous arrays of colour, and the exquisite marble staircases are constricted by the most gorgeous wild flora ... 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The crystalline clear water brims over the edge of mossy drops in smooth, gentle arcs, flowing and cascading among carefully placed boulders, shimmering and looking as though they had been sprinkled with silver ...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even the golden statues appear so lifelike, as if real women were confined in gold ... and in them exists ...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dread?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regardless, we have worked so hard to get here, and the Doctor shoul- will be pleased. My excitement is boundless; there must be countless undocumented species to claim, and no natives to interrupt me – us. And as the sun slips below, the sky melts into a deep, bruised purple, with wisps of pink crushed between emerging stars. The constellation of Andromeda is shattered; disoriented and tarnished, proving the unplaceable nature of this place. I shudder and recite my oath. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tomorrow, I complete our task. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s an unknown journey. I’m … too dainty for it. And my wife’s child is coming. So please, take care.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I will.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Don’t tire yourself. Rest. Be careful. Just, let the others ... do more.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“And what does that mean?”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Just ... you know ...”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Go on.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You know ... an important task is keeping the pristine journal pretty and unspoiled. We need to keep it safe. I think ...”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You think?”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“You must bind it to you and focus on that. You need it. It’s your research.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“What exactly do you mean?” 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“The journal is the peak of your achievement … it’s your life.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I do not understand.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Well ... the rest of the team may ... have some doubts. You’re fierce, independent, assertive … you’re capable … but just with regard to you … leading … those men … given you’re a wo-”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Thank you. Of course!”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“No - I meant-”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Farewell, Doctor.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Cap- Captain!”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
I awake from the call of my name, breathless and drenched. My purpose burns. My status among those simple men was valued but will not last – what I must complete here shall be, by the second night of the solstice. As I prepare my exploratory gear, I strain to detect any signs of life ... only the whispers of a steamed wind ... and the soughing of water nearby ... it is eerie, unnatural. It calms my mind.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
As I saunter through the secluded temples of well-aged Gods, they flaunt their extravagant engineering, unparalleled in beauty and elegance ... at least, they try to – the stone columns evidently crumbled under the weight of time, now subject to the dominion of the very nature they sought to overcome. As I continue along the stone paths, the abundance of fig trees and their broad trunks epitomise strength so effortlessly ... and their fruit is so tempting ... My daze expires when their intrusive roots trap my foot. As I recover and delve deeper into this unknown treasure of creation, I document my findings and species which men could never acquire. My journal will allow me to finally transcend … to overcome those who doubted me! It confines perfect, untouched, immaculate notes, diagrams, depictions … It will be my foundation for a non-existent culture where all of us are served superiority. It is my solution … my gains of hidden truth and power will finally gain respect for me – us! 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But as streams of melted sun tango through the thick overgrowth, my eyes begin to lose focus … my feet scream under the weight of my journey, blistered, sore … time has lost its dimension here, and has certainly escaped my conscience. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve since lost my water, and abandoned my gear. I only require the journal. Happiness flourishes in me. Finally, I feel the centre, nearing our grasp ... my grasp.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My legs tire, and my heart is weary, but the consequences of failure have been bound into the darkest depths of my mind. I must finish … I feel it so close, pulsating, waiting to be claimed! Imagine the respect … the power … I limp, but with utmost urgency! By the second night of the solstice, I shall be gone … so close … but the vegetation grows, now a hideous, vicious abomination. My shirt has since been ripped, and my skin lacerated. Yet, with apprehension now a companion to my previously established ambition … should I- may I really? My decisions falter … but how petty; turning back implies inferiority, and I shall achieve more than those men ever did; they shall suffer. Yet as vines burn my skin, my mind clouds … my journal slips … 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I reach to it, distraught … but my ankle …
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I fall, screaming. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
---
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The vegetation surrounding my body is soft, like the fur of a fawn … yet my body is numb, and my mind sways closer to the verge of oblivion … when  I shift my gaze to the navy sea above, Scorpius is blurred … and the moons …
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Panic manifests in my nerves. I glance at my wrist. Vines have constricted my movement, and dried sweat clings to my skin. Fear revitalises my senses, and my wounds burn against the poisonous grass. Trepidation chokes my thoughts, isolating my thoughts … yet I have none … only my growing hatred ... and the taste of copper plagues my mouth … as the moans of damned souls floor my ears, I recall those women … as I grip my journal, I curse those men … and the Doctor … 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alone, I greet my fate, and my primal, misguided desires in the most deranged form …
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Rationale&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;g&gt;In his play Hedda Gabler, Henrik Ibsen focuses on the character Hedda Gabler to demonstrate how restrictions and expectations on certain genders can lead to destruction and tragedy. Notably, he subtly conveys the idea that “gender” is a construct of society and is a set of mannerisms and traits one of a specific gender must adhere to. He then shows the destructive nature these expectations have on those who do not adhere to these specific traits, and by playing Hedda with the opposite “gender” to her own, Ibsen criticises society’s restrictions on such individuals. This is emphasised through Hedda’s ‘masculine’ interests and disregarding nature (especially disregarding of womanhood and marriage) – shown in &lt;i&gt;“Hedda: Well, anyhow, I still have one thing to kill time with. Tesman: Thank heavens for that! But what is it, Hedda? Eh? Hedda: My pistols, Jorgen.”&lt;/i&gt; (Ibsen, 1890, pg. 295); &lt;i&gt;“Brack: No, no. That wasn’t what I was thinking of either. But suppose now there comes what, in rather solemn language, is called a serious claim on you, one full of responsibility? A new claim, little Madam Hedda. Hedda: Be quiet! You’ll never see anything of the kind.”&lt;/i&gt; (Ibsen, 1890, pg. 306, Act II); and &lt;i&gt;“Tesman: Yes, but have you noticed how plump she’s grown, and how well she is? How much she’s filled out on our travels? Hedda: Oh, be quiet - !” &lt;/i&gt;(Ibsen, 1890, pg. 275, Act I). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While Hedda understands her true desires, she is completely conscious of societal expectations and therefore fears the pursuit of them. She ultimately feels trapped, unable to express her masculinity or femininity, to the point of suicide as a means of escape. This highlights Ibsen’s criticism of society and how its constricting construct of “gender” can prohibit one’s expression of themselves, eventually leading to tragedy. Throughout the play, Ibsen also hints that these constructs are dominated by men in a patriarchal society; the majority of opportunities are in the favour of men, regardless of their gender performativity, as seen with Tesman’s ability to earn (though he is also portrayed as an opposite “gender”, especially acting as a duality with Hedda) and Brack’s freedom (even though portrayed in a similar manner to Hedda). Hence her wrong gender role is the sole limiter of her actions. The theme of confinement and its danger is emphasised by Ibsen’s use of setting; Hedda never leaves the house and is forever confined, helping criticise the dangers of social restriction around gender. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the creative piece, similar to Hedda Gabler, the explorer is portrayed as the wrong “gender” and demonstrates traits that are stereotypically masculine (&lt;i&gt;“… You’re fierce, independent, assertive”&lt;/i&gt;). However, even though she leads an exploratory team, her real gender, portrayed as the wrong gender role, ultimately confines her and her academic growth. It is this confinement that ultimately leads to others doubting her, which results in destruction and madness in the form of her hatred toward all men – this is reinforced through her confusion of equality with superiority over men, as seen in &lt;i&gt;“… It will be my foundation for a non-existent culture where all of us are served superiority”&lt;/i&gt;. Notably, society’s construct of “gender” is dominated by the perspectives of men. This is criticised in the response, and is seen with the Doctor (a male) forcing the journal, a symbol of femininity, upon the explorer – &lt;i&gt;“ ... an important task is keeping the pristine journal pretty and unspoiled … I think ... you must bind it to you and focus on that. You need it” &lt;/i&gt; (the symbol is feminine with the use of “pristine” and “pretty”, feminine adjectives). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The consequences of a patriarchal construct of “gender” and the enforcement of rigid gender identity is shown by the actions of the Doctor; even though he is a male, he is portrayed in the wrong gender role – as shown by his timid and uncertain nature in dialogue, as well as &lt;i&gt;“It’s an unknown journey. I’m … too dainty for it. And my wife’s child is coming. So please, take care.”&lt;/i&gt; - yet he still succeeds. Hence the explorer’s wrong gender role becomes known as the sole factor prohibiting her growth. This restriction and expectation of gender leads to her hatred toward all men. Society’s patriarchal construction of “gender” being the sole limiter on the explorer and the cause of her tragedy is emphasised when the journal physically leads to the downfall of the explorer (because she is so fixated upon the restrictions forced upon her by the Doctor) – &lt;i&gt;“… my journal slips … I reach to it, distraught … but my ankle … I fall, screaming”.&lt;/i&gt; Setting is used in a manner similar to Ibsen again – the explorer never leaves the garden, helping emphasise the message of how social restriction around gender can lead to tragedy. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The similar techniques and approaches in the play and in the response ultimately show and criticise how restrictions and expectations around gender can lead to destruction.

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I write a report in RSweave, I will have a normal .R file on the side to test out code that I will need in the report. However, I also lose discipline at times and I end up completing all code within the RSweave file anyway. At times when I just want to upload the code to Github, I need a quick way to extract all code chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1: set working directory to where the base file is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot; data-lang=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2: set object as file name&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot; data-lang=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;yourfilename.Rnw&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: the base file name must be unique within the working directory. So in the case of RSweave files, where (as it uses LaTeX) after generating a report a bunch of other files with the same base name (but different extensions) are produced, you will need to rename the RSweave file to something completely different and unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3: see below commands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For files operating under knitr, use “purl”. Otherwise use “Stangle” for RSweave variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot; data-lang=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;knitr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;purl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot; data-lang=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Stangle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content><author><name>Conan Liu</name></author><category term="datascience" /><category term="ds" /><summary type="html">Why?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Melbourne Housing Market Analysis</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/datascience/ds/2022/01/12/Report.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Melbourne Housing Market Analysis" /><published>2022-01-12T00:28:16+11:00</published><updated>2022-01-12T00:28:16+11:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/datascience/ds/2022/01/12/Report</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/datascience/ds/2022/01/12/Report.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a self-guided project where I analysed a Melbourne housing market dataset from Kaggle. Credit to Tony Pino for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was conducted completely in RStudio, with the help of RSweave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe loyalty and gratitude are two of the most important, fundamental traits that every person aspiring to be a leader should aim to develop. I don’t think I can think of any other traits from which all issues (professionally or otherwise) boil down to. And the key message lies within “aim to develop”. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Loyalty&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Loyalty is definitely an important one. But loyalty to many evokes the image of comraderie, a marriage, a connection to someone. But loyalty to a person is a huge caveat. Loyalty to a person too often spawns beauracracy, which with its derivative politics only causes the downfall of great teams and kills (competitive) collaboration. Loyalty should be to your word, a set of values, an organisation’s purpose, a vision, mission, or other frameworks that help you become a better person and make better decisions. Because being loyal to a person could mean when they are wrong, you also inevitably agree. However, healthy challenges in a relationship are necessary, and opposition is really the truest form of friendship. When you are loyal to a set of values, it also reflects in character, and you are less likely to shave the truth, and more likely to say the same thing to everyone, regardless of any outcomes. Loyalty leads to character. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gratitude is equally, if not (arguably) more important, than loyalty. In my opinion, gratitude is the single trait that any issue can boil down to, especially in relationships and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Developing these traits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Like any skill, developing loyalty and gratitude takes a conscious effort, time and patience. In many senses, developing these is a process that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first entered Year 11 (2020, about 16-17 years old), we had an opening assembly, and at some point the chaplain of the school came out to deliver her speech. I will admit: I was zoning out. However at some point I started listening and I am grateful I did, because her story about two wolves was powerful, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, without getting into the details of a biblical allegory: within each of us lies two wolves - there is a dark one, and a light one. You may feed either wolf. It is up to you to decide which wolf you want to feed through your actions and thoughts. Do you want to feed the one who is jealous, scheming, and evil? Or the one who is compassionate, kind, and honest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved her story because loyalty and gratitude are trained. You must make conscious efforts every day to stregnthen your loyalty and gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to develop these skills. Personally, I will list something I am thankful for, something I am grateful for, something I am hopeful for, and something I am sorry for, every single day. I do think there is a subtle difference between “thankful” and “grateful”. I do like the definition &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a src=&quot;https://liveboldandbloom.com/07/values/grateful-vs-thankful#:~:text=You%20can%20exhibit%20your%20thanks,in%20both%20fable%20and%20psalm.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Listing such things helps to develop the aspect of reflection that builds gratitude, and enforcing such a habit every day will, over time, mould you to become more appreciative of literally every good thing in your life, no matter how small or large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting about things you are sorry for every day is not to be taken to the extreme. Simply reflecting on where you could have displayed a better attitude or approach to someone, or people, is powerful. And it can especially&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surround yourself. Bitter poeple - bitter you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;actively externally reflect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Food for the soul&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By integrating an RStudio project with Github, you can directly push changes using Git. This is extremely convenient and is actually what I used to build a website for my club, completely within R itself. And, to my observation, you can create a whole project, sync it to a new repo and when you commit+push all your new files, you may upload more than 100 files at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1: create a new Github repository&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go create a new repository. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt; file is optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2: enable Git in RStudio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open your project in RStudio and follow Tools -&amp;gt; Version Control -&amp;gt; Project Setup.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on the SVN/Git tab. Select Git as the version control system. It will ask you to initialise a new Git repo and restart RStudio.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Rstudio reopens, confirm that there is a Git tab in the &lt;b&gt;environment&lt;b&gt; (where you view all your objects) pane (top right by default).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3: synchronise with a Github repository&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RStudio, click on the terminal tab and start a new terminal session. Then enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-terminal&quot; data-lang=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets your terminal directory to home default. Then add next locations step wise. For me, I had my project on my desktop, and its name was “club”. So, I would enter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-terminal&quot; data-lang=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;cd Desktop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-terminal&quot; data-lang=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;cd Desktop/club&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, set an origin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-terminal&quot; data-lang=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;git remote add origin https://github.com/yourUSERname/REPOname.git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you added optional files into your repo, such as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;readme.md&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;license.md&lt;/code&gt; file, enter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-terminal&quot; data-lang=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;git pull origin master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pull them from the otherwise empty repository. If you didn’t add any files, no need for this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, enter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-terminal&quot; data-lang=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;git push -u origin master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you should be ready to commit files to the repository. Along the way you may have needed to sign in to your Github account and entered some keychains if on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4: push files to Github from RStudio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the environment pane, click on the Git tab and then click Commit. This will open a window where you can track files you made changes to. Tick all boxes for files you want to push. If you are using Github to build a website, and you have lots of files changing at once after building it to see how it looks, you can tick one box, go CMD+A and tick all of them. Write a commit message in the adjacent field and then click an up arrow to push.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Conan Liu</name></author><category term="datascience" /><category term="ds" /><summary type="html">Why?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fourier Transform Report</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/academics/academic/2021/04/11/fourier.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fourier Transform Report" /><published>2021-04-11T23:28:16+10:00</published><updated>2021-04-11T23:28:16+10:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/academics/academic/2021/04/11/fourier</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/academics/academic/2021/04/11/fourier.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was an assignment where we had to detail an application of complex numbers. I spent around three days trying to find a great application and landed on the fourier transform from signal analysis videos! The report also includes a wonderful, real world analysis example where a time series is broken into individual sine waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All images that are unreferenced (all but one), including the graphs and spiral images, were all created using functions in R. These were quite finnicky, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ggplot2 was used to plot the cartesian planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report was created using RSweave/LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted the formatting is sometimes… off. Looking back on this I probably would have tried to fix the LaTeX formatting somehow… the pictures sometimes overflow onto the next page leaving huge chunks of white. Too difficult at the time, but for the next project formatting will definitely be a major goal toward the end. Even mathematical working is too long at times, so I need to find a way to present these things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This was an assignment where we had to design a textbook chapter on an application of matrices. I chose neural networks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had to design some problems with worked solutions at the end of the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The textbook was designed in Adobe Illustrator. All diagrams are handmade, also in Illustrator. I used Helvetica Neue for the font in the neural network diagrams, but looking back on this in retrospect, I think another, slightly bolder typeface would have helped the readability (especially with those super/subscript numbers!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using liquid it is possible to directly loop all posts for a certain category or tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-liquid&quot; data-lang=&quot;liquid&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;site.categories[&apos;category&apos;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;limit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;n&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
    &amp;lt;a href=&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;endfor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the (maximum) number of posts that show. It’s the same code for tags; just replace &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site.categories[&apos;news&apos;]&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site.tags[&apos;news&apos;]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Conan Liu</name></author><category term="datascience" /><category term="ds" /><summary type="html">Separating and organinising blog posts by their categories</summary></entry></feed>
